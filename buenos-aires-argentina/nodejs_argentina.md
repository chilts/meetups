## formats

### Talks

Talks are held every month. They are usually one talk with some networking chat after it.
After the meetup, we relocate as a group to one of nearby bars.

look a good place for the talk and comunicate to the other memebers via meetup.com
We are using twitter and g+ too for the comunity.
