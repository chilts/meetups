## formats

we plan to constantly rotate formats on monthly basis. Though community demands and proposals on the table will influence this.

### talk night

Typical. 1 to 3 Talks at length of 25-40 Minutes or shorter. In between and afterwards there is time for socializing.

Talks are proposed by the local community or (sometimes) are organized by the organizer teams.

### open hack space

in this format we gather at a place with wifi and web access and code anything. It's an open-space kind of hackathlon

First, whoever have an idea introduces it in brief (5 min each), then the groups gather and code. Everyone may change group at any time.

### open discussion space

This format is all about exchanging thoughts. Everybody is allowed to speak and join a conversation. It's usually moderated
and if needed it is split into several open spaces.

Orga usually tries to set up a pannel for it.


## process

Proposals can be submitted on the Meetup site, by contacting on twitter or via email. We accept proposals for talks, discussions,
coding or else. Talks should be about Node.js specifics: libs, practices, experiences regarding Node.js development, projects,
operations.

**Important Notice** since we are partnering with the local JavaScript meetup [HH.js](http://www.meetup.com/hamburg-js/), we try to forward proposals with general
JavaScript tone and front-end related stuff there.

Organizers tasks are usually:
- place and schedule of meet ups
- get the talks or set the topic to a certain meetup
- ensure the CoC
- get sponsors
- moderating discussions

Member can give feedback via meetup.com, mail or twitter.

Past presentations are available.
